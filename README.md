Adventure Mode
- Make a method that will always return the words in a String that contain four characters. Called as: four_words(text) Use this to answer the relevant questions in Explorer Mode.
- Make a method that will return the words in a String that are x characters long (as in: how_many_words(text, num))
- What's the total budget of our movies?

Epic Mode
- For our movies array, produce an array grouped by each star. As in:
[
  { :star => "Leonardo DiCaprio", :movies => [...]},
  { :star => "Tom Hanks", :movies => [...]},
  ...
]
Use this new array to output a list of the stars and the movies they appear in to the command line.

- Write a method called starring? that takes an array of movies (say, movies) and a star's name and returns the title of movies starring said star. Use this to help output the above.
- What's the average budget for our movies?
- What's the median budget for our movies?
